# Conditional Statements in Python: Program to Check Whether a Number is Divisible by Both 11 and 3 Using if-else

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to check whether a given number is divisible by both 11 and 4 using ifelse statement.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Start the program.
2. Read an integer from the user.
3. Check the conditions: If the number is divisible by both 11 and 4 (num % 11 == 0 and num % 4
== 0) Print that the number is divisible by both 11 and 4. Else Print that the number is NOT
divisible by both 11 and 4.
4. Stop the program.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
num = int(input())
if num % 11 == 0 and num % 4 == 0:
print(f"{num} is divisible by both 11 and 4")
else:
print(f"{num} is NOT divisible by both 11 and 4")

## Output

## Result
Thus, the program to check whether a given number is divisible by both 11 and 4 using if-else was
executed successfully and the output was verified.
